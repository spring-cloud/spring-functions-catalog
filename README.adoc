= Spring Functions Catalog


In this repository, you will find a collection of components that can meet various data integration use cases and requirements.

The repository's primary focus is to provide a set of standalone Java functions that can be useful in the end-user applications as-is.

Most of these functions are, essentially, auto-configurations for specific https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/endpoint-summary.html#endpoint-summary[Spring Integration Channel Adapter].
These functions can be consumed in the target project any possible way, for example, the `FunctionFlowBuilder` from https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-function/docs/current/reference/html/spring-integration.html#spring-integration[Spring Cloud Function Integration] module can be used to compose an `IntegrationFlow` for any complex solution.

This functions catalog is also a foundation for https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-stream-applications[Spring Cloud Stream Applications] project.
